#MatLab
This is the inital matlab attempts at M/G/1 Queue models, WSU matlab licese does not include the recomended SimEvents Library [https://www.mathworks.com/help/simevents/examples/m-m-1-queuing-system.html] So after inital testing moving to R Studio seems to be prudent.


#R Studio
This repository holds the test models and refrences. Currently M/M/1/k model working 


#Andriod Code
This repository holds the curent stable andriod build. Currenty at 700 lines
